# Keynga - The King of Keys

Keynga is a password manager and generator designed to efficiently manage platform keys in a safe and robust way. It allows users to store passwords encrypted with modern cipher algorithms, using a single master password for access. This project was developed as a portfolio project at [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/) by Collins Kimani.

## Features

- **Secure Platform and Password Management**: Add platforms along with their usernames and passwords. Passwords are encrypted and stored securely.
- **User Authentication and Profile Management**: Registration and login with a username and master password. Users can view their profile information and the list of platforms they have added.
- **Platform Management**: Manage platforms by updating existing platform information or deleting platforms no longer in use.
